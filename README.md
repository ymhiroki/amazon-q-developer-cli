## üöÄ Start Contributing

### Prerequisites

- MacOS
  - Xcode 13 or later
  - Brew

### 1. Clone repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/aws/amazon-q-for-command-line.git
```

### 2. Setup
Hassle-free setup:
```shell
npm run setup
```

Or if you'd like to DIY:

<details>
<summary>Manual Setup</summary>
<div>

### 1. Install platform dependencies

For Debian/Ubuntu:

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config jq dpkg curl wget cmake clang libssl-dev libgtk-3-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev libdbus-1-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libjavascriptcoregtk-4.1-dev valac libibus-1.0-dev libglib2.0-dev sqlite3 libxdo-dev protobuf-compiler
```
### 2. Install Rust toolchain using [Rustup](https://rustup.rs):

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup default stable
```

For pre-commit hooks, the following commands are required:

```shell
rustup toolchain install nightly
cargo install typos-cli
```

For MacOS development make sure the right targets are installed:

```shell
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin
rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin
```

### 3. Setup Python and Node using [`mise`](https://mise.jdx.dev)

Add mise integrations to your shell:

For zsh:
```shell
echo 'eval "$(mise activate zsh)"' >> "${ZDOTDIR-$HOME}/.zshrc"
```

For bash:
```shell
echo 'eval "$(mise activate bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

For fish:
```shell
echo 'mise activate fish | source' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

Install the Python and Node toolchains using:

```shell
mise trust
mise install
```

### 4. Setup precommit hooks

Run `pnpm` in root directory to add pre-commit hooks:

```shell
pnpm install --ignore-scripts
```

</div>
</details>


### 3. Start Local Development
To compile and view changes made to `q chat`:
```shell
cargo run --bin q_cli -- chat
```

> If you are working on other q commands, just replace `chat` with the command name 

To run tests for the Q CLI crate:
```shell
cargo test -p q_cli
```

To format Rust files:
```shell
cargo +nightly fmt
```

To run clippy:
```shell
cargo clippy --locked --workspace --color always -- -D warnings
```



### üí° Quick Tip for Onboarding

Use Q CLI to help you onboard Q CLI! 

Start a `q chat` session:

```shell
q chat
```

Once inside `q chat`, you can supply project context by adding the [`codebase-summary.md`](codebase-summary.md) file:

```shell
/context add codebase-summary.md
```

This enables Q to answer onboarding questions like:

- ‚ÄúWhat does this crate do?‚Äù

- ‚ÄúWhere is X implemented?‚Äù

- ‚ÄúHow do these components interact?‚Äù

Great for speeding up your ramp-up and navigating the repo more effectively.




## üèóÔ∏è Project Layout

Several projects live here:

- [`autocomplete`](packages/autocomplete/) - The autocomplete react app
- [`dashboard`](packages/dashboard-app/) - The dashboard react app
- [`figterm`](crates/figterm/) - figterm, our headless terminal/pseudoterminal that
  intercepts the user‚Äôs terminal edit buffer.
- [`q_cli`](crates/q_cli/) - the `q` CLI, allows users to interface with Amazon Q Developer from
  the command line
- [`fig_desktop`](crates/fig_desktop/) - the Rust desktop app, uses
  [`tao`](https://docs.rs/tao/latest/tao/)/[`wry`](https://docs.rs/wry/latest/wry/)
  for windowing/webviews
- [`fig_input_method`](crates/fig_input_method/) - The input method used to get cursor
  position on macOS
- [`vscode`](extensions/vscode/) - Contains the VSCode plugin needed
  for the Amazon Q Developer for command line to work in VSCode
- [`jetbrains`](extensions/jetbrains/) - Contains the VSCode plugin
  needed for the Amazon Q Developer for command line to work in Jetbrains IDEs

Other folder to be aware of

- [`build-scripts/`](build-scripts/) - Contains all python scripts to build,
  sign, and test the project on macOS and Linux
- [`crates/`](crates/) - Contains all internal rust crates
- [`packages/`](packages/) - Contains all internal npm packages
- [`proto/`](proto/) -
  [protocol buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) message
  specification for inter-process communication
- [`tests/`](tests/) - Contain integration tests for the projects

Below is a high level architecture of how the different components of the app and
their IPC:
